#+Title: Arkham Horror Digitalization
* TODO Introduction
* TODO Phases
Each turn consists of 5 phases, each player completes each phase at the same time.
** TODO Upkeep Phase

 During the upkeep phase, players refresh any exhausted items.
 Make any upkeep checks.
 And may rearrange their skills.

** TODO Movement Phase
At the start of the Movement phase, if the player is in Arkham, they are given a number of movement points equal to their current speed stat.
A player can then move from one location to another as long as they are connected, and they have enough points.
A player can stop moving at anytime, but if they would pick up a clue or encounter a monster they must stop moving.
** TODO Arkham Encounter Phase
** TODO Otherworlds Encounter Phase
** TODO Mythos Phase
* TODO Locations

** TODO Arkham
Arkham is where most of the game takes place.
It is divided up into a number of streets and sublocations.

#+name: arkham-map
#+BEGIN_SRC python :noweb yes 
  ARKHAM = {}

#+END_SRC

** TODO Other Worlds
Other worlds are places that players can get to via portals.
Each other world is comprised of two sections. Entering through a portal
will place the player in the first section of the other world.
During movement an explorer will move to the second section.
If they are in the second section, they leave the other world via any connected portals.
If there are no connected portals, the player is lost in time and space and are moved to the void.
** TODO Misc
Miscellanious locations are places that players and monsters end up only given special circumstances.
These include:
 + The Sky
 + Outskirts
 + The Void
Things that get moved to any of these locations will only move out given special circumstances.
For example a monster in the sky will move out to attack a player in the street, and then move back to the sky.
When a player gets lost in time and space they are moved to the void until they can get back.
Monsters moved to the outskirts will only leave when the outskirts are full.
** Location Object
Locations which include streets, places, and other worlds are represented by a location object.
These should be stored in a dictionary named Arkham, and Other_Worlds.
There are a number of optional settings and variables.
These include:
 + White
 + Black
 + Stablity
 + Is Street 
Different arguments are needed for different locations but the base class is the same.
If these are not given when initalizing the object they are ignored.

If no connections are given it defaults to a blank tuple.
If no players or monsters are given to a location it defaults as a blank list.

** TODO Arkham Table Reader
This is a small helper program used to get the information stored in the arkham table and translate it into location objects.
These are then fed into the game to produce the map.
* TODO Arkham Locations
:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:  %ITEM(Location) %NAME(ID) %WHITE(White Connections) %BLACK(Black Connections) %CONNECTIONS(Street Connections)
:END:
The map of Arkham is made up of streets, and locations.
The Location column references the location's "pretty" name. This is what shows up when the game references it in text.
The ID column is the key for the map, these are what are passed around when players and monsters move, as well as 
what the engine will look for.
White Connections Column is where monsters will go if they are to move on a white connection.
Black Connections Column is where monsters will go if they are to move on a black connection.
Steet connections are how the streets of arkham connect. They are also assumed to be connected to their white and black connections.
