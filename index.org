:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:  %ITEM(Location) %NAME(ID) %WHITE(White Connections) %BLACK(Black Connections) %CONNECTIONS(Street Connections)
:END:
The map of Arkham is made up of streets, and locations.
The Location column references the location's "pretty" name. This is what shows up when the game references it in text.
The ID column is the key for the map, these are what are passed around when players and monsters move, as well as 
what the engine will look for.
White Connections Column is where monsters will go if they are to move on a white connection.
Black Connections Column is where monsters will go if they are to move on a black connection.
Steet connections are how the streets of arkham connect. They are also assumed to be connected to their white and black connections.

* Location Object
Locations which include streets, places, and other worlds are represented by a location object.
These should be stored in a dictionary named Arkham, and Other_Worlds.
There are a number of optional settings and variables.
These include:
 + White
 + Black
 + Stablity
 + Is Street 
Different arguments are needed for different locations but the base class is the same.
If these are not given when initalizing the object they are ignored.

If no connections are given it defaults to a blank tuple.
If no players or monsters are given to a location it defaults as a blank list.

* Tests
I wrote a test runner that can be invoked in this document.
To call a specific test simply make a call tag like so:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+call: run_test(x="test")
#+END_EXAMPLE
Please note that you will need to omit the py extension.
If the tests succeed the result section will be blank, 
if the test fails you will get a pop up from the bash output.

#+name: run_test
